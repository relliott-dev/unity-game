Thanks for purchasing this package! I will try and keep this short and sweet.

The code for these weapons is split into two example classes, ExampleWeapon or AnimatedExample weapon with the difference here being the use of TransitionalObject.
If you don't want to use this framework then you can stick with ExampleWeapon and write the animated version to suit your needs.

The main methods you should be interacting with are:

ExampleWeapon.SetState()

This determines if the weapon is reloading, firing or waiting to fire (disabled and displaying a red light). Firing and reloading will be set automatically from the 
animation so you should only need to set the states to either start firing or stop (waiting state).

Everything else should be exposed to the editor allowing you to edit the ifirng or reloading speed and the animation will automatically update. If you want a speed
that is not in the range in the editor check the ExampleWeapon class and look for a section: [Range(0.15,1)]. This controls the slider in the editor and will let you set
higher or lower values once edited.

One thing to note is if you wish for a quicker firing speed then be careful of the weapons with recoil! These have hard set values to avoid looking unnatural, such as 
a small delay after each recoil. To remove this edit the Delay on the Transition In tab of the Transitional Object on the Barrels but I don't recomend removing the delay entirely!
