Hello there everyone, again!

 So, the deal with the Space Ship.
 While it is not officially part of this package, I still included it. Maybe you find the Movement Script useful.
 Maybe you love the Sprite. If the last statement is true, go to http://millionthvector.blogspot.de . I got it from him.
 He has tons of other sprties on there to, mostly compatible with each other. It's all under CC 4.0, so pretty simple to use for you guys.

 If he, anyhow, reads this or anyone knows him, here's a big shout-out to him. Man, you are awesome!

 So, without further ado, use the link, use the Sprite (but credit him, otherwise you'll have licensing issues), use the Script.
 Oh, and if you need a script, where the Space Ship faces the cursor and flies towards it. I'll gladly send you that movement script,
 if you need it. I just won't include it, as Spaceship Controls are not part of an Space Ambience package. Sumanai (=jap. "Sorry") :)

 Oh, and before I forget: Welcome to the area of the package which actually does not belong here!
